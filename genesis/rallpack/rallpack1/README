Specification of Rallpack 1 :

=============================================================================

1. Objective 
Tests the ability of the simulator to handle a uniform unbranched passive
cable model.

=============================================================================

2. Simulation
This simulation models a simple uniform unbranched cable with
1000 identical compartments, with a length constant of 1, a diameter
of 1 micron, and a total length of 1 mm. The membrane properties are :

RA = 1.0 ohms meter		= 100 ohms cm
RM = 4.0 ohms meter^2		= 40000 ohms cm^2
CM = 0.01 Farads/meter^2	= 1.0 uf/cm^2
EM = -0.065 Volts		= -65 mV
ELEAK = EREST = EM

A current of 0.1 nA is injected in the first compartment. Membrane voltages
are recorded for the first and last compartments.
This model is run for a simulated time of 0.25 seconds.

=============================================================================

3. Theoretical solution
The 'correct' solution is based on the Laplace-transform solution
of the finite cable with constant current injection, with a factor of 2.0
scaling using the method of 'reflections' since our system has current
injection in one end. See "Electrical current flow in excitable cells",
OUP, 1983; Jack, Noble and Tsien, pp 79,80, also pp 68. This solution is
a sum of a series, and therefore its accuracy depends on the number of
terms used in the sum. The use 10 terms gives at least six figure accuracy.
The correct solution is implemented in the directory rallpack/theor. It
may be run using the command 'currinj'; the default settings correspond
to rallpack1.
The correct waveforms (provided in this directory) are
ref_cable.0	Laplace transform solution for current injection site
ref_cable.x	Laplace transform solution for far end of cable.
These reference waveforms start at time 0 and have 5001 data points,
ending at time 0.25 sec. If a simulator saves the output values at the end of
every time step as opposed to the beginning, it may be necessary to shift
the output curves by one time step.

The error function 'erfc' used by the theoretical solution is from
"Numerical recipes in C", CUP 9188; Press, Flannery, Teukolsky and Vetterling.

The root mean squared comparison with the theoretical solution is
performed with the function 'rms' provided in the rallpack/comparison
directory.

Detailed report :
        1 Accuracy vs. Timestep
        2 Accuracy vs. Simulation speed
                A set of simulations of the same model size should be run at
                a range of timesteps, and the accuracy and simulation speed
                should be calculated for each case.
                The timesteps should cover the 'useful' range for the model,
                within which the accuracy goes from close to its asymptotic
                (best) value to a few % error. Typical timesteps are
                10,20,50,100,200,500 and 1000 usec. The recommended model size
                is 1000 compartments. The model size should be quoted.
                These results can be tabulated and/or graphed.
                If the raw speed is independent of timestep (i.e. the
                simulation speed is directly proportional to timestep, which is
                usually true) the two graphs can be merged, and the respective
                x axis scales should be displayed.
                The x axis may be displayed on a log scale.

        3 Raw speed vs. Model size
        4 Model memory per compartment vs. Model size
                A set of simulations with a range of model sizes should
                be carried out, calculating the raw speed and model memory
                for each case. All simulations should use the same timestep,
                which should be quoted. The suggested timestep is 50 usec.
                Recommended model sizes are 1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10000
                compartments.
                These results can be tabulated and/or graphed.
                If graphed, they may be displayed on the same graph with
                the two y axis scales displayed.
                The x axis may be displayed on a log scale.
