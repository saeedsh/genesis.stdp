Notes about running the tests
2000-04-26 <mhucka@bbb.caltech.edu>

If you want to run the tests of the SPRNG generators, first execute the
following command after compiling the random number generators:

	  make PLAT=someplatform

where "someplatform" is the value of the variable MACHINE that you specified
in the GENESIS src/Makefile.  For example, on Linux, PLAT=Linux.

To run the tests, go back to the parent directory and run

   ./checksprng
