The "netcdf-3.4" subdirectory here contains the entire contents of the
netcdf-3.4 distribution, plus a file named "copyright.html" which is the
online version of the copyright notice for netCDF 3.4.  (Despite what the
manifest and other files claim, the netCDR 3.4 distribution did not contain a
file called "COPYRIGHT".  In order to make sure that there is a copyright
notice somewhere, we manually added the copyright page from the netCDF web
site.)

NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is an interface and library for
