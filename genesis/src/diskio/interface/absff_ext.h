 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2005/06/14 04:38:29  svitak
 * Import from snapshot of CalTech CVS tree of June 8, 2005
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2000/06/12 05:07:02  mhucka
 * Removed nested comments; added NOTREACHED comments where appropriate.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  1999/10/16 21:53:59  mhucka
 * Merged Upi's changes for supporting netCDF 3.4.  The changes in most files
 * only involve the copyright notice.  I also fixed up the comments slightly
 * to reflect the location of the actual netCDF copyright file.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  1999/10/16 21:25:06  mhucka
 * Venkat had a version of the diskio code in his home directory that he
 * appears to have been working on, and that did not make it into the
 * source tree that I had originally used as the starting point of my
 * GENESIS 2.2.2 DR reorganization effort.  In order to merge Venkat's
 * changes into the distribution, I'm reverting to his version, then will
 * update his version to incorporate recent changes by Upi for netCDF 3.4.
