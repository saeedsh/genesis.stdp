         Statement on Models and Experiments.

    Animal experimentation is fundamental to research in biology. Certain
groups claim that computer models can replace animal experiments. This is
absurd. Computer models would be meaningless if it were not
for the enormous amount of careful research that the scientific
community has carried out on animal subjects over the years. All
aspects of realistic models, from the theory to the parameters to the
design of the interface, are based on experiments. While computer models
can help with understanding and relating existing data, they can, at best,
merely provide hints towards discovering hitherto unknown biological facts.
I am fully in support of the idea of using models as a supplement
to understanding biological function when combined with laboratory work
or a study course. I will be delighted if such a supplement can lead to more
effective and humane use of animal subjects. However, I flatly disagree
with the philosophy that this, or similar modeling tools, can replace
animal experimentation as a means for extending our knowledge of
biological systems. If these views are offensive to you, I urge you not to
use this library (kinetics), both because it would be hypocrisy on your part
to use a product of animal experimentation, and because it would go
against my objectives in writing this software.
