The genesis/src/contrib directory contains contributed programs that are
separate from the GENESIS installation, and that are not compiled by
default.

The xplot directory contains source code and a Makefile for the xplot program,
a plotting program originally written by Matt Wilson, and modified by Mike
Vanier.  This program (which is unrelated to the GENESIS object of the
same name), may be used to view the results of parameter fits and to
compare them with the target data.  It also has many other uses.  The file
xplot.txt describes the many commands and options that can be used with
xplot.  xplot/README gives installation instructions.
