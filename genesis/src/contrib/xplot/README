This directory contains source code and a Makefile for the xplot program,
a plotting program originally written by Matt Wilson, and modified by Mike
Vanier.  This program (which is unrelated to the GENESIS object of the
same name), may be used to view the results of parameter fits and to
compare them with the target data.  It also has many other uses.  The file
xplot.txt describes the many commands and options that can be used with
xplot.

The Makefile has a few defines that you may need to edit for your own
environment.  It is currently set up to use gcc as the C compiler under
Linux.  There are other settings that you can uncomment for Solaris.  By
default, it uses /usr/local/bin as the installation directory.  If you do
not have privileges to write to this directory, you should edit the
INSTALLDIR line in order to install it in a directory of your own.

Type "make" or "make default" to compile it, and "make install" to
copy it to the installation directory.
