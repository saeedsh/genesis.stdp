ConClamp Demo
- this GENESIS script simulates the response of a space-clamped
patch of squid giant axon membrane to a step current injection.
- the membrane consists of standard continuous and deterministic
Hodgkin-Huxley gating particles.
- a step current injection is applied to the membrane and
the dynamics of this current injection I(t), the membrane voltage V(t),
the membrane currents INa(t) and IK(t), and the ionic conductances
gNa(t) and gK(t) are observed.

I. Installment
- the script for the UnClamp demo is contained within
five files:
                <sim_obj.g>
                <forms.g>
                <messages.g>
                <graphs.g>
                <ConClamp.g>

- running the script <ConClamp.g> will initiate the simulation

II. Units
                time            ms
                voltage         mV
                current         pA
                area            um2
                conductance     pS
                capacitance     pF
                density         channels/um^2

III. Simulation Operation
- for given membrane surface area, Na and K channel densities,
Na and K open channel conductances, membrane leakage conductance
per unit area, leakage voltage,  membrane capacitance per unit area,
initial injection current, step injection current,
time and duration of current step, the simulation computes the
dynamics of the membrane voltage based upon the standard lumped
parallel circuit model used in compartmental modeling (see
Strassberg and DeFelice, 1992, CNS Memo).  The response of the
membrane currents and conductances also can be observed.

ConVClamp Demo
- this GENESIS script simulates the response of a voltage- and space-
clamped patch of squid giant axon membrane to a step change in
membrane voltage.
- the membrane consists of standard continuous and deterministic
Hodgkin-Huxley gating particles.

I. Installment
- the entire script for the VClamp demo is contained within the
file <ConVClamp.g>.

II. Units
                time            ms
                voltage         mV
                area            um2
                conductance     pS
                density         channels/um^2

III. Simulation Operation
- for given membrane surface area, Na and K channel densities,
Na and K open channel conductances, initial holding membrane
voltage, and final holding membrane voltage after the voltage
step, the simulation computes the behavior of the total membrane
conductances to Na and to K, gNa(t) and gK(t) respectively.
