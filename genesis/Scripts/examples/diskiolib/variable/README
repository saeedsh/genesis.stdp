This directory illustrates dumping and restoring simulation data from files,
using the variable object in the diskio library.  The xgraph object is used 
for the display.  The documentation for these two objects gives further 
details of their use.

Note:

Since variables can be arbitrarily created only in file formats that 
support the notion of variables to store data, such as in netcdf, 
these scripts will fail if the diskio element attempts to support FMT1.

Files:
1. generate.g
	This is derived from one of the xview examples. It generates the data
	that will be stored in the netcdf format
2. testfile.nc
	This is the data file produced by generate.g. It is entirely portable
	between different machine architectures. 
3. replaygraph.g
	This reads in data from the file and uses the variable object to plot 
	on an xgraph.


The difference in using variables for sending and receiving messages directly
as opposed to the diskio element is in the calculation of element fields.
'ny' for the diskio is not set in this case and has to be calculated from
the number of variables. This method is still crude since arbitrary variables
can be created in a netcdf situation.
