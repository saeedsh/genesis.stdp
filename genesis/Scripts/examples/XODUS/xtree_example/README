xtree example
Upi Bhalla Mount Sinai June 1995.

This is an example of using the xtree for displaying and manipulating
the hierarchy of GENESIS elements. This mode of use is very similar
to the xtree in the old Xodus, but there are many more facilities.

RUNNING:
cd into this directory
start GENESIS
type tree


You will see a window with lots of funny looking icons.  (Some of these
will be out of view, to the right.  Remember that you may pan the draw
window by using the cursor arrow keys.)
- The triangles represent neutrals
- The cylinders represent compartments
- The funny shapes that look like a voltage gated channels are
	voltage gated channels. This won't be much help unless you already
	know what a voltage gated channel looks like.
- The christmas-tree like object represents an xtree
- Anything which the xtree has no explicit icon for is represented
	by a rectangle. This includes the tables
- The arrows represent messages

THINGS TO DO:
1. Click on any icon. The name of the element should
	be printed in the genesis console.
2. Double-click on an icon which has children. The children will
	vanish and the icon will now be 'stacked' to indicate that
	it has children but they are shy.
3. Double click on the icon again.  The children will reappear.
4. Look at the hierarchy of the /cell element on the xtree.
	It is a flat hierarchy, which is the convention. In other words,
	all compartments are children of the /cell element. Verify this
	by doing

		le /cell

5. Let us change this to a hierarchy based on the tree structure of
	the cell itself. Click on dend1 and drag it onto the soma.
	Poof ! The tree changes to reflect this new hierarchy.
	Do 
		le /cell/soma

	to verify that the same change was done to the genesis element
	hierarchy.

6. Lets change the hierarchy from the command line. Do

		move /cell/dend2 /cell/soma

	from the command line. Funny. Nothing happens. This is because the
	xtree has not been told about the change. You can force an update
	in two ways:
	- Double click on the cell, twice. The clicks force an update.
	- Call the RESET action for the tree:
		call /form/draw/tree RESET

7. Some strange people believe that a tree should grow upside down,
	with the root on top and the leaves below. I have found it
	is much easier to give them what they want, rather than argue
	with such people. To allay whatever childhood trauma they underwent
	from the fact that the leaves of the tree are at the top (and
	hence a longer fall to the ground), you can turn the tree upside
	down:
		setfield /form/draw/tree orientation down
		call /form/draw/tree RESET
		setfield /form/draw ymin -6

	For the severely emotionally stricken, you can even turn the tree
	on its side:
		setfield /form/draw/tree orientation left
		call /form/draw/tree RESET
		setfield /form/draw/tree orientation right
		call /form/draw/tree RESET

	of course, you may have to adjust the dimensions of the draw
	window to be able to see the tree in this configuration.
