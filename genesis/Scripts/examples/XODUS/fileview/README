Fileview examples

This directory illustrates dumping and restoring simulation data from files,
using the FMT1 format.  The data is saved using the disk_out object, and is
read in using the disk_in object.  The xview object is used for the display.
The documentation for these three objects gives further details of their use.

Files:
1. generate.g
	This is derived from one of the xview examples. It generates the data
	that will be stored in the FMT1 format
2. testfile
	This is the data file produced by generate.g. It is NOT portable
	between different machine architectures. If you cannot read this file,
	run generate.g on your machine first.
3. fileview_hack.g
	This shows a quick and dirty way of reading the testfile. It requires
	a priori knowledge of the 3-dimensional layout of the stored data,
	which we have in this unusual case.
4. fileview_better.g
	This is a clean way for reading the testfile. It reads in the 
	3-d coordinate info from the testfile itself. If anything, it is
	a little more efficient than fileview_hack.g, and it is certainly much
	more general.

Each of the example files has a run and a quit button, so the use of these
files should be obvious enough.

Exercise for the reader:
Why do the displays of the fileviews look a little different from the displays
in generate.g ? (Hint: the generate.g file displays different fields using
the color and morph_vals, respectively).
