The examples in this directory illustrate the use of the basic
widgets and the draw and some of the pixes. To run them type

genesis <filename>

More detailed examples are given in the subdirectories:

fileview - illustrates dumping and restoring simulation data from files,
    using the disk_out, disk_in,and xview objects.  This is equivalent to
    (but more flexible than) using the obsolete GENESIS 1 xfileview object.

netkit - the "Netkit" network builder example from Chapter 20 of "The Book
    of GENESIS".

xtree_example - an example of using the xtree object for displaying and
    manipulating the hierarchy of GENESIS elements.
