March 1993 changes to Neuron tutorial from version distributed with
GENESIS 1.4

1) spike/axon removed (cell.g) - it isn't used for anything

2) reorganization of control panel buttons; dialog box for "Cable Compts."
instead of a separate menu (forms.g, make_cable.g)

3) All menus fixed so that changes are applied whenever a dialog box is
modified.  The "DONE" button merely hides the menu. (forms.g)

4) Cell parameters menus now have dialogs for RM, CM, RA, length and diam.
Changing these produces changes in the Rmem, Cmem, Raxial dialogs. (forms.g)

5) RM and CM (aka rm and cm) were changed from 10 and 0.05 to 5 and 0.025.
This preserves the electrotonic length of the dendrite and cable sections
(0.1), but the smaller membrane resistance makes it possible to have a
reasonable Eleak with EREST = -70 and values of ENa and EK which allow
hyperpolarization after a spike.  EK and EInh were changed from -75 to -80.
The resulting Eleak = 11.7 + EREST_ACT = -58.3. (constants.g)

6) The default values of the synaptic channel gmax was changed to 0.1 nS
for both channels.  (GEx = Ginh = 100e-9 mS/synapse, instead of 80e-9
and 40e-9.) (constants.g)

7) Input timing (Delay, Width, Interval) was changed to source A = (10, 50,
   10) and source B = (20, 50, 10).

8) Changed "Eequil" to "Esyn" for the title of the Ek dialog boxes for
dendrite sections.   Now use "xshow_on_top" for Inputs and parameter menus
so that they won't get buried by dend2 graphs.

9) Rewrote the following files to take into account the new changes:

running.hlp, totry.hlp, exercises.txt, solutions.txt

10) For consistency, changed the label of the "Quit Help" button to "DONE".
(helpforms.g, help.hlp)

==============================================================================
March 1995 - many changes for GENESIS 2.0 version.

The channelC2's and axons have been replaced by spikegen/synchan combinations.

XODUS 2 widgets are used.

The vdep_channels have been replaced by tabchannels, although the many plots
(particularly the clock 0 spike plots) are the main bottleneck.

The color cycling of overlayed Vm plots has been removed.  It will have
to be implemented differently with new graph widgets.
==============================================================================

Possible future changes:

* Allow one to change the size and other parameters for the cable sections.
At present they use the default values for dendrite #1 and #2.

* Allow color cycling.
