The genesis/contrib directory contains contributed programs that have utility
for some GENESIS users.

The genesis-mode package provides XEmacs major modes for editing GENESIS
scripts.  To use it:

1. Put the files in the genesis mode package somewhere in your
   home directory, e.g. in the directory "~/genesis/xemacs-mode/".

2. Put in your emacs initialization file :
   (load-file "~/genesis/xemacs-mode/genesis-vars.el")
   (load-file "~/genesis/xemacs-mode/genesis-langs.el")
   (load-file "~/genesis/xemacs-mode/genesis-mode.el")
   (load-file "~/genesis/xemacs-mode/genesis-files.el")

Alternatively, these can refer to the location within the contrib
directory, e.g.

(load-file "/usr/local/genesis/contrib/xemacs-mode/genesis-vars.el")
