.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I Convert
converts a GENESIS 1.x script file
to GENESIS 2.x syntax replacing old command names and arguments
with their GENESIS 2.x counterparts.
Without arguments
.I convert
will read standard input and write to standard output.
With arguments
.I convert
reads from and writes to the given file names.
If the
.I newscriptfile
argument is not given,
.I convert
will output to a file with the same name as the input
file less any directory path.
If a directory path is not given for the input file
output is written to standard output.
.LP
To convert entire script sets
UNIX command shell loops may be used.
Assuming that an old set of scripts
lives in the directory ../oldscripts,
then the following will convert the entire script set.
.LP
For csh:
.nf
.sp
foreach file (../oldscripts/*.g)
    convert $file
end
.LP
For sh:
.nf
.sp
for file in ../oldscripts/*.g
do
    convert $file
done
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
.B \-constants
.LP
To correctly translate a script
.I Convert
needs to know the names of globally defined variables
in a script set.
The
.B \-constants
option is used to identify the scripts
in which these global script variables are defined.
More than one script may be specified.
.LP
.B \-noX1compat
.LP
The automatic translation of create commands for Xodus objects
to objects in the X1compat library may be suppressed using the
.B \-noX1compat
option.
In this case, converted scripts will use the Xodus 2 objects
directly.  This will work most of the time for the standard
Xodus 1 interface objects, but will likely fail for the
draw widgets and pixes.  xgraph widgets may also fail when
not using X1compat but have a better chance of working than
xdraw et al.

of the GENESIS Reference Manual.
.SH BUGS
.LP
.I Convert
is not a complete conversion solution.
See the Doc/convert.doc help file for a
complete discussion of conversion issues
including a list of problem areas.
.LP
.I Convert
will delete the contents of the input file
if the output filename is the same as the input file name.
This can be done implicitly if the input filename path
refers to a file in the current directory using a relative path
(e.g. convert ./file.g).
.LP
.I Convert
makes use of the X1compat script set
for compatibility with GENESIS 1.x graphical interface elements.
The X1compat script directory should be added to the SIMPATH
and the X1compat script called from the .simrc
or the main simulation script.
.LP
.I Convert
translates network models using GENESIS 1.x connections
to commands in the connection compatibility library.
This library is not included by default in the GENESIS 2.x
executable.
See the GENESIS Reference Manual for details on compiling
GENESIS 2.x with the connection compatibility library
and for tips on rewriting network simulations using the
new network modeling objects and commands.
