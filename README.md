Genesis
=======

GENESIS is a general purpose simulation platform which was developed to support the simulation of neural systems ranging from complex models of single neurons to simulations of large networks made up of more abstract neuronal components.  Most current GENESIS applications involve realistic simulations of biological neural systems.  Although the software can also model more abstract networks, there exist other simulation packages that are more suitable for backpropagation and similar connectionist modeling.
